           AI Video Prompt (Vertical 9:16, under 9s)
            Core Science Fact: Bananas are naturally radioactive.
            Voiceover Profile:

            Pace: Rapid but perfectly articulate, finishing clearly under 8 seconds.
            Tone: Awe-filled and mischievous, like revealing a wild secret.
            Character: A charismatic science communicator, playful and energetic.
            Video Structure & Script:
            Instant Hook (0‚Äì1.5s):

            Visual: Extreme close-up of a banana glowing faintly in the dark, crackling with neon-green sparks.

            Voiceover (fast, dramatic whisper): ‚ÄúWhat if I told you‚Ä¶ bananas are radioactive?‚Äù
            Synced Reveal (1.5‚Äì8s):

            Visual: Camera swings in one seamless arc as the banana splits open‚Äîinside, a glowing radioactive core pulses with energy. The shot transitions into a sweeping zoom through a pile of bananas, Geiger counter sparks clicking with each flash. Radiation symbols momentarily flicker in the air before dissolving.

            Voiceover (energized, racing with visuals): ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right! Bananas contain potassium-40, a radioactive isotope‚Äîtiny amounts, totally safe, but yes‚Ä¶ they actually emit radiation!‚Äù
            Final Beat (8‚Äì8.9s):

            Visual: A single banana floats against a black background, glowing neon green. Bold text overlay slams in: ‚ÄúBananas = Radioactive üçå‚ö°‚Äù

            Sound: Sharp electronic zap + bass drop, then instant silence.
